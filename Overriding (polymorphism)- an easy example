# Example of Overriding(same method in different class : 
# Child class is chirandi(stubborn) and will perform the method that it commits rather than obeying father's method)

class Father:
	def task_at_5PM(self):
		print('Do your homework')
	
class Son(Father):
	def task_at_5PM(self):
		print('I will play cricket')
		
Son1 = Son()
Son1.task_at_5PM()

# OUTPUT:
# I will play cricket
