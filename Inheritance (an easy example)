Program for concept of inheritance :

class Inheritance():
	def property(self):
		print('owns a house')
	def vehicles(self):
	    print('owns a car and a bike')
	    
class Son(Inheritance):
	def bicycle(self):
		print('owns a bicycle')

print("Details of Son1")
Son1 = Son()
Son1.property()
Son1.vehicles()
Son1.bicycle()

print()
print("Details of Son2")
Son2 = Son()
Son2.property()
Son2.vehicles()
Son2.bicycle()

print()
print('Details of Father')
Father = Inheritance()
Father.property()
Father.vehicles()
Father.bicycle() # This will generate error as bicycle was exclusively child's property.
